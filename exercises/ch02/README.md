# Pure Puzzles

This chapter is focused on problem-solving techniques. For that reason the
programming skills required are minimum, but the difficult of the problems
is not trivial.

## Review of C++ used

The programming skills required by the book:

- Control statements: `if`, `for`, `while`, `do-while` and `switch`.
- Know how to write and call functions.
- Use of the standard stream objects: `cin` and `cout`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using std::cin;
using std::cout;
```

## Review of Java used

The only difference with C++ is at stream objects. Java has
two analogous stream objects: `System.in` and  `System.out`.

The programs will use the following import statements:

```java
import static java.lang.System.in;
import static java.lang.System.out;
```

## Problems 1-3: Output Patterns

In this section will focus on the use of the output streams and reduction
techniques to solve problems.
