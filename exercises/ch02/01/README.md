# Exercise 2.1: [Output Patterns]

## Problem Statement

Using only single-character output statements that output a hash mark, a
space, or an end-of-line, write a program that produces the following shape:

 ```txt
 ########   
  ######   
   ####  
    ##
```

## Approach

I have broken down the problem into different parts:

* Print one single line of hashes.
* Print a next line with 6 hashes wrapped by 4 spaces.
* Print the line 4 times with a loop.
* Create an inner loop with an algebraic expression that reduces the number of
hashes.

## Implementation Notes

* Inspired on the input processing example of the book, I have designed the
expression of the inner loop using a symbols table.
* The created expression `hashnum <= (10 - 2 * lineNum)` decreases the width
of the hash line two on each step. I have chosen 10 to start the line number
at 1
