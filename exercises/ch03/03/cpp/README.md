# Exercise 3.3: [Array Sort Checker]

## Problem Statement

Write a `bool` function that is passed an array and the number of elements  
in that array and determines whether the data in the array is sorted. This  
should require only one pass!

## Approach

To solve this exercise I have chosen to apply the criterion-based search
technique. When insertion sort processes and array that is already sorted,
it only makes one pass!.

## Final Notes

I have provided a very basic test to test the functionality. C++ prints `bool`  
types as if they were integers.
