# Chapter 7 Solving problems with code reuse

After a few exercises I realized I had to copy and paste the `studentRecord`
class all the time so I decided to encapsulate it in its own file (And this
chapter is about learning code reuse right?). To compile
the solution of these exercise now use:

```bash
g++ ../shared/student_record.cpp main.cpp -o main.exe
```
